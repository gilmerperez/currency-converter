- Fallbacks: `Inter`, `sans-serif`

**Font Weights:**
- 300 - Light

### Colors

| Use Case              | HSL Value                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| Page Background       | `hsl(138, 100%, 20%)`   |
| Accent (Buttons/Text) | `hsl(97, 72%, 67%)`     |

## Final Notes

This specification sets the foundation for a functional, performant, and user-friendly currency converter. The layout should be developed using a **desktop-first approach** with careful attention to responsiveness. Code should follow best practices and be structured for readability, accessibility, and future extensibility.
